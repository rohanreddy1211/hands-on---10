Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, and AVL Tree Implementations
This repository contains implementations of three tree data structures in Python:

Binary Search Tree (BST) - A basic, unbalanced binary search tree.
Red-Black Tree (RBT) - A balanced binary search tree using color properties and rotations.
AVL Tree - A balanced binary search tree using height-based rotations.
Each tree implementation includes these operations:

Insertion
Deletion
Search
In-order Traversal
